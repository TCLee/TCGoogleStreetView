We'll let CocoaPods do all the hard work for us.\r\n\r\nRun the following commands in `Terminal.app`: \r\n```\r\n$ cd <YOUR_PROJECT_DIRECTORY>  \r\n$ pod install  \r\n$ open TCGoogleStreetView.xcworkspace\r\n```\r\n\r\n####Step 3: Generate your Google API Key\r\n1. Go to [Google API Console](https://code.google.com/apis/console/) and generate your API key.\r\n2. In Xcode, open `TCGoogleStreetView\\AppDelegate.m` and replace with your own API key:\r\n  \r\n  ```Objective-C\r\n  // Replace with your own API key generated using Google APIs Console.\r\n  static NSString * const kTCGoogleMapsAPIKey = @\"YOUR-API-KEY\";\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n###Unit Tests\r\nTCGoogleStreetView includes a suite of unit tests in the `TCGoogleStreetViewTests` directory. The unit test framework used is **XCTest**, so you can run the unit tests easily from XCode using the shortcut &#8984;U.\r\n\r\n##See Also\r\n* Google Maps SDK for iOS - <https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/ios/>\r\n* SDWebImage - <https://github.com/rs/SDWebImage>\r\n\r\n##License\r\nThis project's source code is provided for educational purposes only.
